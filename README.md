# Social Distancing Effectiveness

This project endeavors to visualize the effectiveness of social distancing measures against the COVID-19 pandemic. We perform k-means cluster analysis to identify classifications of how strict social distancing government mandates are in each of the 50 U.S. States. We then use these groupings to visualize coronavirus cases and deaths in each state.
